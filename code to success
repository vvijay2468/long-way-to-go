In the ruins of time, where decay whispers loud,(1)
A species once scorned rose from the crowd.(2)
Hungry for hope, though their ways seemed absurd,(3)
They danced in the dark, defying the word.(4)

How their stench carried tales of despair,(5)
Yet in their odd rituals, a spark flared there.(6)
The truth lay hidden in filth and grime,(7)
As their wisdom evolved through ages of time.(8)

They thrived where others could only fade,(9)
With courage their crude civilization was made.(10)
Putrid and proud, they stood undeterred,(11)
Singing to stars with each guttural word.(12)

A sign appeared, the days ticking by,(13)
4 strange omens lit up the sky.(14)
The intellect buried in graveyard lore,(15)
Held the key to humanity’s door.(16)

They carved their symbols in earth and clay,(17)
Willing the stars to show them the way.(18)
Through odd numbers, the riddle was sung,(19)
"From death comes life," in their guttural tongue.(20)

A graveyard planet, a doomed last chance,(21)
Brought salvation's glimmer in their dance.(22)
The path to rebirth, though steep and gray,(23)
Might just lie in their fetid display.(24)

What’s unseen beneath this grotesque mirth?(25)
The Answer that stirs from the depths of earth.(26)
Symbols align as the stars hold their breath,(27)
Hope reborn in the face of death.(28)

Though shunned at first, these creatures grew,(29)
A journey of worth the cosmos knew.(30)
The 7 signs spoke of a rising tide,(31)
An ascension to truth they couldn’t hide.(32)

Realization came in whispers and cries,(33)
That brilliance sometimes wears a crude disguise.(34)
From 3nd chances and acts that seemed odd,(35)
The beasts: became more than a wink of God.(36)

In their filth lay the universe's final quest,(37)
Quest to unearth the future from decay/s cruel jest.(38)
So seek them now, these saviors divine,(39)
For the answers they hold may soon be mine.(40)
